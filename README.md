# Flowlist 📚

### Name of the Team: Debug Web-Bug 

### Title of the Project: Flowlist

### Project Description:

A productivity website with a minimalistic UI designed to allow users to navigate and create essential components for day-to-day tasks. These components include a to-do list area and a note-taking section as tasks.
When creating tasks, users can prioritize what tasks are important by filtering them by date, category, and reminders. They can also organize the workplace by moving different tasks around the page to their liking. Spreadsheets, tables and other toolkits can also be integrated inside lists.

### Functional Requirements Draft

1. Users can login in a startup page using a input box called username and password type interface to access their account on Flowlist
2. Users can access different types of essential  components such as tasks, lists, inbox, trash bin, etc by clicking on a “=” button on the top left of the website. This will open up a sidebar for quick links/buttons to different types of components. The sidebar can close if the user clicks the “=” button to have more space for their component.
3. Users can create new tasks by clicking a “+” or “add task” button.
4. Users can search for tasks by clicking on the Search bar with the magnifying glass and typing in names of the tasks.
5. Users can mark completed tasks as completed by ticking the box next to it with a check mark.
6. Users can add multiple pages inside a task to organize different sections of a task.
7. Users can add start and end dates for tasks at the top the page inside a task/list.
8. Users can sort through and prioritize tasks.
9. Users can categorize tasks by dragging them into folders.
10. Users can take task-related notes by writing on a blank page. 
11. Users can customize task-related writing/notes by changing its fonts, text colour, text highlight, alignment, and other commands like bold, underline, and italicize text in a pop up box that displays these options.
12. Users can organize old tasks by putting them in organized archiving folders for later use. 
13. Users can remove unnecessary tasks into the trash folder. The trash folder will keep the curtain tasks/lists for a curtain duration of time. Once the curtain duration of time is met, the contents inside the trash folder will be permanently deleted forever.
